/* Additional Ideas: 

When a player beats the computer, you may check the player's score against the current high score of that game,
 and see if a new record has been achieved. This would resolve in one of two ways - either the player has scored
higher than the previous high score, or they didnâ€™t. Boolean.

let currentHighScore = true;
How do you make code to check previous high score and compare to current high score? Do you use a JS Function?

function checkHighScore(userScore, highScore) {
if (userScore > highScore) {
return true; //new high score achieved
} else {
return false; //no new high score
}
}

or use something that starts with 
playerScore <= 10, play again. Once they get to 10, game over.

For funny comments use template literals with backtick ` so can add user's name
let funnyWinnerComment1 = `asdflkjsdfkjsdkfj, ${player}!`;
let funnyWinnerComment2 = `blah blah blah`;
